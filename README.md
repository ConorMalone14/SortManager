# SortManager

SortManager is a peice of software that generates arrays to be sorted by a variety of different sorting algorithms. These algorithms can then be compared against eachother.


## Usage

```
Enter option:
```
This first input requires a number that exists on the menu. If it is not a number or outside this range it will ask you to try again.
```
Enter length of array to automatically generate:
```
Enter a number greater or equal to 1 to generate an array of that length.
```
What would you like to do?
0. Compare All
1. Compare 2 Algorithms
2. Rank All Algorithms with extensive testing
3. Use a generic sort
```
If you chose 0 for your first option this menu will be displayed. The generic sort uses wildcards. The compare all and Rank All algorithms run all sorts and Rank All displays some statistics across multiple runs.
```
Please Enter First Algorithm

Please Enter Second Algorithm
```
This option is shown if you chose 1 from the second menu. You must select a number between 1 and 7 as they are the only valid sorts.
